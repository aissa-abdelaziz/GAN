# Animal Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform image classification of two types of animals: cows and horses. The primary objective is to enhance the accuracy of the classification model as much as possible. Additionally, the project addresses the challenge of missing data by implementing various techniques, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), for data augmentation using the available dataset.
